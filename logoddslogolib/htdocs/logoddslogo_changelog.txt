LogOddsLogo Release Notes

1.0 (2014-02-28) [Yi-Kuo Yu, Aleksandar Stojmirovic, Stephen Altschul]

LogOddsLogo is derived from WebLogo; it replaced WebLogo's routines for
generating positional information scores with ones based on a log-odds
formalism.  It is implemented as a separate module, called logoddslogolib,
which implements only the necessary changes from WebLogo, and the logoddslogo
script.

* We have replaced WebLogo's column information content code with four
   scoring routines, the first two of which use the log-odds formalism:

   - BILD (Bayesian Integral Log-odds) score (score_method='BILD')
   - Normalized Maximum Likelihood score (score_method='NML')
   - Schneider and Stephens' corrected entropy-difference score
     (score_method='SC')
   - The uncorrected version of Schneider and Stephens' score
     (score_method='SU')

* The new measures do not provide error bars, so this option has no
   effect now.

* We have added an additional parameter 'dmnumber', that specifies
   a Dirichlet or Dirichlet mixture prior for the BILD score.  For
   proteins, 'dmnumber' is an integer, which indexes a collection of
   pre-computed and internally-coded Dirichlet mixtures.  For nucleic
   acids, it specifies a single floating-point concentration parameter.

* We have added an option ('ovline') to determine logo boundaries
   using a one-dimensional version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm.
   The boundaries are indicated graphically by drawing an overline
   over the logo region with maximal aggregate.

* For protein logos only, we have added an option to estimate the
   effective number of of independent observations for each amino acid,
   based upon correlations among sequences in the multiple alignment.

* The new routines are available both as a C extension and a Python
   module.  The C extension code is not compiled by default but it can
   be easily turned on.

* We have replaced the background amino acid frequencies used by
   WebLogo with Robinson & Robinson frequencies.

* We have modified the EPS template for generating logos to allow
   negative values of the column information measures.

* We have modified tests and examples to use the new information
   measures.

* We have changed license notices to indicate that NCBI's
   contributions are in the Public Domain.

* We have created a website for LogOddsLogo by making various
   modifications to the WebLogo website:
   - The website's structure is mostly unchanged, but we have
   redesigned the logo creation form, and split it into separate
   interfaces for proteins and nucleic acids
   - We have changed the appearance of the website to be congruent
   with the QMBP group's website at the NCBI.
   - We have created API documentation for all three components
   (logoddslogolib, weblogolib and corebio) and created links to
   it from the manual.

* We have added a protein sequence example file, Prot.fa

WebLogo Release Notes

3.3 (2012-07-02) [Gavin Crooks, David Sivak]

* Improved the algorithm that guesses the sequence type (DNA, RNA or protein)
	(Kudos: Bug report, Roland Pache <Roland.Pache@ucsf.edu>)
* Fixed an issue with reading transfac matrices with alternative alphabets
	(Kudos: Bug report, Nima Emami <emami.nima@gmail.com>)
* Fixed Motif.reindex()
* Implemented Motif.reverse() and Motif.complement()
	(Can now reverse complement transfac matrix input on the command line.)
	(Kudos: Feature request, Seth P Boudreaux <spboudre@bcm.edu>)
* Command line interface now automagically recognizes transfac files.
* Add command line option "--reverse-stacks NO" which inverts the logo stacks
	so that the most conserved monomers are at the bottom of the stack, rather than
	the top. This ordering is consistent with the standard ordering for histograms,
	and is arguably a better representation.
	(Kudos: Luke Hutchison <luke.hutch@mit.edu>)
* Fixed an issue so that the correct color scheme is chosen
	for the specified sequence type.
* Miscellaneous minor bug fixes and refactoring.



3.2 (2012-01-30) [Gavin Crooks, David Sivak]

* Graphical interface now accepts transfac format motif files.
* New output format option: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
* Miscellaneous minor bug fixes and refactoring.


3.1 (2011-08-16) [Gavin Crooks, David Sivak]

Mostly bug fixes, code improvements and minor user enhancements.

* Command line: Add parsing of transfac PWM files
* Command line: Add reverse and complement transformations
* Improve clustal file parsing
* Currently compatible with python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7
* Deprecate support for python 2.3 and 2.4
* Migrate corebio library into weblogo for easier maintenance and development.
* Add new annotate option for custom annotation line
* Miscellaneous minor bug fixes and refactoring.

* Incorporates bug fixes and feedback from Gavin Crooks, John Gilman,
Kevin Schutz and Perry Evan.



3.0 (2008-10-14) [GEC]

A significant update of WebLogo.

New and improved feature include:

* Simplified GUI. More useful options, less obscure options that are rarely
  used.
* Several choices of unit including bits and nats, and corresponding energy
  measures such as kJ/mol.
* Error bars are smaller and more discrete.
* The size of logo stacks is consistent (Does not change with sequence length.)
* The width of the characters in a stack are scaled by the fraction of non-gaps.
  Therefore gappy columns are visually less important than columns with gaps.
* Three standard logo sizes.
* Can now read many multiple sequence alignment formats, including
  CLUSTALW, FASTA, plain flatfile, MSF, NBRF, PIR, NEXUS and PHYLIP.
* High resolution PNG output.
* New, rational, easy to use command line client.
* Python based API library.
* New color schemes, including Watson-Crick pairing, hydrophobicity and charge.
* I (Isolucine) now shows crossbars, so that the letter is distinguishable
  from a line.
* Colors can be specified using CSS2 syntax.
* Optional figure label.
* Conservation is now calculated as the Bayesian posterior mean relative
  entropy. (This is the most significant change scientifically. The math
  needed to get this right is very interesting.)
* Similarly, we now display Bayesian 95% confidence intervals for error bars.
* Compositional adjustment.

* Includes contributions from Clare Gollnick, David Ding, John Gilman.
* Incorporates bug fixes and feedback from John Reid, Gordon Robertson,
  Eric Odell, Krisztina Gabor, ...
* Incorporates or adapts ideas and code from Gary Hon, Steven Brenner,
     John-Marc Chandonia, Liana Lareau, Ed Green, James Casbon, Jeffrey Chang,
     Frank Kauff, Cymon J. Cox,   ...
