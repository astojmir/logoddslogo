LogOddsLogo (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/logoddslogo/) is a tool
for creating sequence logos from biological sequence alignments. Building on
the WebLogo (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com) source code, LogOddsLogo uses
per-observation multiple-alignment log-odds scores as measures of information
content at each position of a sequence logo.

It can be run on the command line, as a standalone webserver, as a CGI webapp,
or as a python library.
